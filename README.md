# Hypnos
A Sleep Tracker App



## Description

[Link to deployed app](https://project-hypnos.herokuapp.com/)

**Hypnos** is a sleep tracker app designed by Jeneth, Kira, Diogo, and Robert for the second of three projects in Coding Boot-camp at UCSD Extention. 

As we’re all keenly aware, even one night of bad sleep can affect you the next day. Not only are you more likely to feel sleepy, you’re more likely to be in a bad mood and be less productive at work.  When you throw in the fact that we’re in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, sleep becomes even more crucial as it plays such an important role in our physical and mental health.

This project utilizes MySQL databases, a third party login screen, Materialize.css, and Chart.js among others to bring you a user friendly app.

## Usage

Hypnos is hosted on Heroku. While the Home and Team pages are viewable to all. When you click "get started" you will be asked by "Auth0" to login. Auth0 is a reputable third party login program so there's no need to worry about your data.

**Please note:** if you are using this application after the 28th of October 2020, Auth0 will no longer work. This is because the free trial will have run out. This will have no effect on the app other than the fact that you will not have to login for any pages and your data will not be secured.
